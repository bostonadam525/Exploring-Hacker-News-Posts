# Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts
Data Analysis Project using Kaggle dataset


Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Conclusions from this analysis:
This analysis examined the average number of posts for 3 categories: Ask HN, Show HN, and Other. We only went into more detail with the Ask HN posts since they were more likely to receive comments.
Our Analysis concludes that the best time to leave a post appers to be in the afternoon. The ideal time is 15:00 or 3pm eastern time, but it should be noted that 13:00 (1pm) and 12:00 noon were right behind. Therefore one would want to post in the early to mid afternoon to receive a comment.
We did not go into more detail with the "Other_Posts" or "Show HN" posts. Perhaps another analysis for another time. This would especially be interesting since the most number of posts do occur in the "other" category.
